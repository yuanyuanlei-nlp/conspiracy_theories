## Event Relation Graph
* **Dataset:** We used MAVEN-ERE dataset for building the event relation graph (https://github.com/THU-KEG/MAVEN-ERE)<br/>
* **mavenere_event_relation_label.py:** the code for processing the event relations labels<br/>
* **event_relation_graph.py:** the code for training the event relation graph

<br/>

## Conspiracy Theories Identification
* **Dataset:** We used LOCO dataset for the conspiracy theories news identification experiments. (https://osf.io/snpcg/)<br/>
* **Data Splitting:** The document id of train/dev/test sets under media source splitting are in the ./LOCO/LOCO_media_split folder. The document id of train/dev/test sets under random splitting are in the ./LOCO/LOCO_random_split folder (section 4.2)<br/>
* **conspiracy_event_relation_graph.py:** the code for conspiracy news identification based on event relation graph
